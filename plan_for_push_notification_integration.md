Push Notification Integration Plan for Medication Reminder

Information Gathered:
- Backend has medication reminder routes to add and list reminders.
- Frontend fetches reminders and shows alert notifications locally every minute.
- No existing push notification integration.

Plan:

1. Frontend (frontend/src/components/MedicationReminder.js):
   - Add service worker registration for push notifications.
   - Add UI button to request notification permission and subscribe to push notifications.
   - Send push subscription object to backend API.
   - Remove or complement existing alert-based reminders with push notifications.

2. Backend (backend/routes/Medicinereminder.py):
   - Add new route to receive and store push subscription info per user.
   - Add route to send push notifications (for testing or manual trigger).
   - Integrate with push notification service (Firebase Cloud Messaging).
   - Add scheduler (e.g., APScheduler) to send notifications at reminder times.

3. Backend Models:
   - Add new model or extend user model to store push subscription info (e.g., endpoint, keys).

4. Dependencies:
   - Backend: pywebpush, APScheduler, firebase-admin (if using Firebase).
   - Frontend: firebase SDK or use native Push API.

5. Followup Steps:
   - Install dependencies.
   - Test push notification subscription flow.
   - Test scheduled push notifications.

Dependent Files to Edit:
- frontend/src/components/MedicationReminder.js
- backend/routes/Medicinereminder.py
- backend/models/user_model.py or new model for push subscriptions
- backend/app.py or new scheduler service file
- backend/requirements.txt
- frontend/package.json (if adding firebase SDK)

Please confirm to proceed with the implementation of this plan.
